        <p class="disclaimer hidden-xs">This is a copyright. That means you can't have it. I know our parents taught us to share as kids, but I called my mom and she said this was different. I called a lawyer, because you can't always trust your mom, and he said the same thing! So, I guess we own this, and you don't. Let's keep it that way. If you really want something of mine, I'll be happy to give you a free smile.</p>
