					<h3>Do Web Design Trends Matter?</h3>
					<p>We're coming up on the end of the year, and in the marketing world, that means we're looking at emerging trends for next year. Marketers do this all the time, but is it really relevant for most people?</p>
					<p>I won't waste your time listing out all of the emerging trends for 2018, but I will explain why we should take them with a grain of salt. And, more importantly, what these trends mean for the real world, normal people, and regular businesses who are trying to impress customers (not just designers).</p>

					<h3>5 Things to Know Before Hiring a&nbsp;Designer</h3>

					<h3>6 Reasons to Avoid Free Sitebuilders</h3>
					<p>A couple of days ago, I was talking to a potential client about the web design process, the timeline, and most importantly, the price. He responded with a question that I hear quite a bit:</p>
					<p><em>Why should I pay you that much when I can just build one on Squarespace for free?</em></p>
					<p>When I get asked about site builders, I have a pretty straight-forward response, that usually helps people understand.</p>

					<h3>Why You Need Mobile Design</h3>
					<p>Do something for me today. Count how many times you use your smartphone. Think about how many times you look something up really quick, or reference a website, or open an app. I bet it's more than you realize.</p>
					<p>I can't count how many times I've heard that "mobile is here to stay." I know you've heard it as well, so it's no secret that businesses need to be thinking about mobile users when they're looking at website design.</p>
