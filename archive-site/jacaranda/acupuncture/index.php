					<h3>Acupuncture</h3>
					<p>Acupuncture is an East Asian medical technique that dates back over 5,000 years. It involves inserting very thin, sterile needs into specific locations in the body called acupoints. These points lie on various meridians, or channels, throughout the body and have actions and indications used to restore balance within the body.</p>

					<h3>Shiatsu</h3>
					<p>Zen Shiatsu, created by Shizuto Masunaga, is a Japanese-style massage that works on select meridians throughout the body. Instead of a localized, deep-tissue massage, Shiatsu is a full body massage that uses light pressure to activate meridians and bring the body into a state of balance and thus, optimal functioning.</p>

					<h3>Cupping</h3>
					<p>Fire cupping therapy involves heating glass cups via a flame, which creates negative pressure inside the cups, and placing them on the body. The negative pressure creates a vacuum, drawing the skin into the cup. The suction reaches deep in the tissues, breaking up stagnation and pulling toxins and metabolic waste up to the surface.</p>

					<h3>Gua Sha</h3>
					<p>Gua sha is another technique that addresses blood stagnation in the tissues. Utilizing flat tools (ceramic, copper, jade, rose quartz, and other semiprecious stones carved to have a firm, flat surface) to "scrape" along the muscle fibers to release stagnation. "Gua" refers the scraping motion, and "sha" refers to the visible waste that is being expelled from the body.</p>

					<h3>Facial Cupping</h3>
					<p>Facial cupping works in a similar way to fire cupping, except it doesn’t use heat to create a vacuum, and the cups are not stationary, so no bruising is created. Once suctioned, the cups move upward and around the face, increasing blood circulation and draining toxins through your lymph system. This gentle and relaxing treatment will tighten your skin and brighten your complexion, while also relaxing any tension held in the face and jaw.</p>

					<h3>Sound Therapy</h3>
					<p>These sessions are profoundly powerful and lusciously blissful. The treatments start with off-body energy work, activating subtle energy fields and the Light Body. Using various instruments, such as tuning forks, crystal singing bowls, and crystal singing pyramids, are used proceeding the bodywork to bring you into harmonious alignment. Due to our cells constantly vibrating, sound is able penetrate our bodies down to our very core. This allows our body to step into a state of relaxation, where we can re-calibrate and attune to our truest, most divine selves.</p>
