						<p>We started Red Tower with a hope: that marketing could be different. We've all been at this for years, and we keep seeing the same things over and over again. But just because we've always done it that way, doesn't mean it's the best way to do it. And considering we spend hours upon hours pouring over research on best practices, marketing trends, data, and analytics, we knew that we could do something better. And that's what we're here to do.</p>

					<p>We are not a big-box agency. We are a small collective of incredibly passionate designers, illustrators, programmers, and writers. We don't do cookie-cutter websites. We don't try to wedge you into a template. We look at what you do, we learn about your company and your message, and we craft an experience that perfectly aligns with your goals. That's a lot of marketing speak, I know. But truth be told, we just want to make really good websites for really good people. And we want to create marketing materials, and email campaigns, and brands that will put those really good websites to work. We have your back.</p>

					<p>My website is crucial to my fashion business. From first glance, visitors need to understand who I am, what I do and how I can help promote their business on a variety of levels. That’s exactly what Red Tower has done for me &mdash; in the best possible way, and with an amazing amount of help and encouragement along the way. I would recommend Red Tower to anyone who wants a fabulous website with top-notch customer service &mdash; and who wouldn’t want that?</p>

					<p>As a hairstylist, everything about my world is visual. My website needs to be a reflection of my creative talents, and who I am as an artist. I feel like this team really took the time to understand who I am and created a website that best reflects my creative tour deforce. Now I feel proud to send potential clients to my website, and I have Red Tower to thank for that!</p>

					<p>I have a growing business that needed an updated and elevated website to appeal directly to my target market. Red Tower Digital considered all of my needs (and questions about how to keep my site modern and accessible), and I am over the moon with the results. They offered just the right amount of guidance while also delivering on the aesthetic that I was after. These guys are the best: creative, easy to work with, AND innovative. I am so lucky to have found them&hellip;and will continue to work with them as my business grows!</p>
