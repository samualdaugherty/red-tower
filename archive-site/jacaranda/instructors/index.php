					<h3>Tamilyn Banno</h3>
					<p>Tamilyn Banno first developed an interest in natural healing while in high school. She began to delve into the realm of health through exercise and nutrition, not only for physical well-being, but also mental and emotional stability. Holistic health became increasingly more important as she aligned with its principles of seeing the human as a whole being instead of a set of symptoms. As she began to learn about acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, she immediately felt drawn into formally studying this ancient medicine.</p>
					<p>Tamilyn graduated with a bachelor’s in Sociology from Illinois State University in 2014. She obtained her master’s in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine from the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine in 2018. She has a particular interest in mental health, women's health, and pain disorders. Her practice is influenced and guided by other areas outside of East Asian medicine, such as sacred geometry, lunar wisdom, plant medicine, sound healing, and various movement practices.</p>

					<h3>Aaron Dickerson (RYT-200 Certified)</h3>
					<p>Aaron is a veteran of the U.S. Army. What he offers through his classes is a way of developing a personal practice that can be taken anywhere, and can accommodate any lifestyle. After more than 20 years of practice in Muay Thai, and a stint in the U.S. Army, Aaron began to investigate yoga as a home workout that would be compatible with his irregular work hours as a welder. In researching the history of yoga, he saw potential in what cultivating a daily yoga practice might do for him physically and mentally. After successfully quitting smoking, yoga helped him regain his breath and repair his body and mind. The personal practice that he has developed over the past few years and what he passes on to students relies heavily on Ashtanga-inspired sequencing. Earning his RYT-200 at Tapas Yoga Shala in 2015, Aaron continues to study the history and tradition of yoga both on and off the mat, and hopes to help make yoga accessible to anyone of any background.</p>
