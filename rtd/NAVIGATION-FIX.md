# Navigation & Header Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. Navigation Integration
**Problem**: Navigation was separate from the header  
**Fix**: Integrated navigation directly into the Hero component as part of the header

### 2. Initial State (Page Load)
**Problem**: Navigation was open on page load  
**Fix**: 
- Navigation starts closed with only the cream plus icon visible
- Nav links are hidden initially
- Opens automatically when user scrolls past 50px

### 3. Navigation Background
**Problem**: Background was separate and not behind nav  
**Fix**: Hero component is now full 100vh with background image covering entire header including navigation area

### 4. Plus Icon Color & Animation
**Problem**: Icon didn't match Figma design  
**Fix**:
- Cream colored when closed (initial state)
- Rotates 135° and turns red when opened
- Uses "Quick" animation: 400ms with cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1)

### 5. Nav Links Animation
**Problem**: Links didn't slide in from left  
**Fix**:
- Links slide in from left with Framer Motion
- Staggered animation (50ms delay between each)
- Cream text on black background
- Hover: accent red color
- Active: accent red color

### 6. Button Text Color
**Problem**: Black text on black background (invisible)  
**Fix**: Removed hardcoded `text-black`, now inherits cream (fg) color from parent

### 7. Animation Timing
**Problem**: Inconsistent animation durations  
**Fix**: All animations now use "Quick" (400ms) with proper easing

### 8. Header Height
**Problem**: Header wasn't consistently 100vh  
**Fix**: Hero section uses `h-screen` class for full viewport height

### 9. Extra Content
**Problem**: Homepage showed content from multiple pages  
**Fix**: Homepage now only shows Hero section

## Current Behavior
