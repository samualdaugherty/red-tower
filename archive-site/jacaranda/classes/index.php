					<h3>Hot Vinyasa</h3>
					<p>During our Hot Vinyasa sessions, we focus on marrying breath (Ujjayi) with postures (Asanas). Each inhale and exhale is coupled with a pose or posture that aligns throughout the entire practice. Please note that this session is an athletic one and will test your endurance both mentally and physically. Ambient temperature will rise to between 85 and 90 degrees F to assist in the detoxification process and keep the muscles loosened. This is a demanding session, but do not be intimidated! Hot Vinyasa might just be the new experience you've been looking for.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Ashtanga</h3>
					<p>We take our time to educate and cover the fundamentals of Ashtanga, including breath, movement and accurate posturing in each class. Ashtanga utilizes the same core structure of our Vinyasa classes but we slowly start introducing the Primary Series into our practice. Ambient temperature will rise to between 95 and 105 degrees F to assist in the detoxification process and keep muscles loose.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Malibu Iron Yoga</h3>
					<p>Our Malibu Iron session combines Vinyasa fundamentals with basic static weight training. This combination flawlessly bridges the gap between two cornerstone practices while establishing the foundation you need to grow your yoga skill set and providing a full-body workout. Please note that despite the inclusion of weight training, this class will not make you look big or bulky!</p>
					<p>*The full Malibu Iron Yoga experience is exclusive to Jacaranda's studio. You won't find it anywhere else!</p>

					<h3>Gentle Yoga</h3>
					<p>A gentle yoga class designed for adults of any age, including those with minor physical ailments or who prefer a slower paced, more relaxed practice. In this class we focus on creating strength and widening range of motion in and around the joints as well as throughout the back and body. Gentle stretching, asana, and breath work keeps us limber in body and mind.</p>

					<h3>Yin</h3>
					<p>A calming and balancing practice that safely stretches the connective tissue for greater joint mobility. Using props to support us in this restful practice to reduce stress and anxiety in the mind and body, we simultaneously deepen our relaxation practice. This class is appropriate for all levels.</p>
					<p><strong>Benefits of Yin Yoga</strong> -  Increased circulation, improved flexibility, relieved inflammation, release of fascia throughout the body, migraine relief and the ability to sit longer and more comfortably in meditation.</p>

					<h3>Restorative Yoga</h3>
					<p>Our Restorative session is a quiet and internally-focused practice. We begin with gentle movements to warm muscles and calm the mind and body in preparation for supported postures. Poses utilize props and are held for several moments, releasing muscular tension and enhancing breath awareness. Restorative yoga is meant to assist in achieving total relaxation. After attending this session, you should look forward to better sleep, digestion, a stronger immune system, and a more peaceful mind.</p>

					<h3>Hot Pilates</h3>
					<p>We've added heat to the basic principles of Pilates in this session. This is a full hour designed to fully target your abs, glutes, arms, and inner thighs all while remaining on your mat! Expect a full-body workout with a deep emphasis on core strengthening and toning. Your abs will thank you!</p>

					<h3>Iron Pilates</h3>
					<p>We've taken our standard Hot Pilates principles, added a dash of H.I.I.T. (High Intensity Interval Training) and sprinkled in some serious fat-burning sequencing that's going to keep your heart rate up and deliver the full-body results you're looking for. This is an all-levels, low impact, hybrid that will safely push you to your limits. If you're looking to break out of a mundane workout routine, needing to burn off some stress and ready to start seeing results - this is the class for you!</p>
					<h3>Reformer (All Levels)</h3>
					<p>A reformer utilizes spring-controlled resistance to build core strength, endurance, coordination, increase flexibility, improve posture and other muscle imbalances you may have in your body. Your core is used throughout the entire class to stabilize the torso while you move the limbs or as a mobilizer of the spine in flexion, extension and rotation. Props may be used to bring body awareness to an exercise or to add challenge.</p>
					<p>It's a great way to tone the entire body with major emphasis on your core.</p>
